	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\CommandElectric\NBprobeCone1m
		#MRS-NBprobeCone1m-titl = MRS Guidance Nose-Cone
		#MRS-NBprobeCone1m-desc = Most space agencies seem to think that starting with manned missions is the way to go. At MRS, we disagree, and think it is much safer to send automated rockets into the sky first. This guidance unit will let you do so in style!

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\CommandElectric\NBprobeRadial
		#MRS-NBprobeRadial-titl = MRS Radial Controller Panel
		#MRS-NBprobeRadial-desc = Sometimes there just isn't a good place to put controlling electronics inside your vehicle. Radially attached probe core, to the rescue!

		#MRS-NB0mLFOengine1-titl = MRS Liquid Fuel Engine, 0.625m "Sparkler"
		#MRS-NB0mLFOengine1-desc = Ooops, someone forgot to inform this engine that it's so small. What business does it have being so efficient in a tiny little form factor?

		#MRS-NB2mNuclearEngine-titl = MRS Nuclear Quad Engine, 2.5m "Quad Nuke"
		#MRS-NB2mNuclearEngine-desc = Four LV-N Atomic rockets in one! Don't be too put off by that large, scary radiation symbol. The exhaust actually isn't very radioactive. We promise.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Engine\NB3mHoundEngine
		#MRS-NB3mHoundEngine-titl = MRS Liquid Fuel Engine, 3.75m "Hound"
		#MRS-NB3mHoundEngine-desc = Relatively efficient for a chemical rocket engine, the "Hound" is designed to move reasonably large payloads in style.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Engine\NB3mQuadEngine
		#MRS-NB3mQuadEngine-titl = MRS Liquid Fuel Engine Cluster, 3.75m "Quad Cluster"
		#MRS-NB3mQuadEngine-desc = Determined to out-do Kerbodyne's engineers, the MRS design team came up with what they consider to be one of the most massive engines to date. It does indeed out-thrust the KS25x4 Mammoth, but at the expense of some vacuum efficiency.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Engine\NBintake0m
		#MRS-NBinstake0m-titl = MRS Intake, 0.625m Ram Air

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Engine\NBintake1m
		#MRS-NBintake1m-titl = MRS Intake, 1.25m Ram Air
		#MRS-NBintake1m-desc = Very similar to the C7 model, this engine saves slightly on weight at the cost of additional funds, and slightly less intake capacity.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\FuelTank\NB0mtank1
		#MRS-NB0mtank1-titl = MRS Fuel Tank, 0.625m Probe
		#MRS-NB0mtank1-desc = Sometimes highly explosive things can come in small packages. Conveniently, this is indeed a small package. However, we'll leave the explosion rate to the mission specialists.

		#MRS-NB0mtankJet1-titl = MRS Jet Fuel Tank, 0.625m Small
		#MRS-NB0mtankJet1-desc = Sometimes highly explosive things can come in small packages. Conveniently, this is indeed a small package. However, we'll leave the explosion rate to the mission specialists.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\FuelTank\NBjumboThreeQ
		#MRS-NBjumboThreeQ-titl = MRS Fuel Tank, 2.5m x 5.625m "Three Quarter Jumbo"
		#MRS-NBjumboThreeQ-desc = When you need more fuel, but not quite on a "Jumbo" scale, this tank gives you a nice in-between capacity to work with. Our engineers assure us that, mathematically speaking, it will give you the same bang for the buck.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\FuelTank\NBminiOrangeR
		#MRS-NBminiOrange-titl = MRS Fuel Tank, 2.5m x 1.875m "Quarter Jumbo"

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\FuelTank\NBwhiteJumbo
		#MRS-NBwhiteJumbo-titl = MRS Fuel Tank, 2.5m x 7.5m "Striped Jumbo"
		#MRS-NBwhiteJumbo-desc = A big stripey fuel tank for all your rocketry needs. Plus, it's notably more stylish than a certain orange variant of the same fuel capacity.

		#MRS-NBrcs5block-titl = MRS RCS Thruster Block, 5-Way
		#MRS-NBrcs5block-desc = Despite widespread belief to the contrary, it appears to be completely possible to build monopropellant valves small enough, that a 5-way thruster block is possible within a managably small housing. True story!

		#MRS-NBrcsCorner-titl = MRS RCS Thruster Block, angled "corner"
		#MRS-NBrcsCorner-desc = What does quantum mechanics have to do with RCS thruster blocks? Absolutely nothing! Gauranteed to contain no quantum components.These RCS thrusters are angled to allow use on the diagonal "corner" positions of your vehicle, and still thrust efficiently in the direction you are steering.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Resources
		#MRS-NBinlineDrill-titl = MRS Inline Excavator Drill and Tank
		#MRS-NBinlineDrill-desc = After finding some Kerbodyne drills that apparently fell off of a truck, MRS engineers decided to enclose them in cylindrical casings (also fallen from a truck), for ease of use. WARNING: Do not use as the root part of a vessel. Can result in vessel deletion due to a stock KSP issue with the drill.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\RTG
		#MRS-NBrtg1-titl = MRS-RTG1 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator
		#MRS-NBrtg1-desc = A slightly larger, more heat tolerant source of consistent electrical power that can also double as a space heater inside of rovers, for the enterprising sojourner. This however is untested, so experiments may be required to sate the curiosity of intrepid pathfinders. Such an opportunity should not be wasted. That is the spirit of exploration, is it not?

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\StructuralAero\NBadapter1x4
		#MRS-NBadapter1x4-titl = MRS Stack Adapter, 1.25m to 4x 0.625m

		#MRS-NBadapter2-1-titl = MRS Adapter, Aerodynamic 2.5m to 1.25m
		#MRS-NBadapter2-1-desc = Through extensive atmospheric testing, using rapid gravitational acceleration techniques, it was determined that this adapter might be slightly more aerodynamic than the leading competitor. Or then again, maybe not. The results were inconclusive.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\StructuralAero\NBadapter2x5
		#MRS-NBadapter2x5-titl = MRS Stack Adapter, 2.5m to 5x 1.25m
		#MRS-NBadapter2x5-desc = After realizing that five circles won't fit into one circle of twice the size, the development cost of this adapter sky-rocketed by requiring the use of external fairings. Yes, the fairings are supposed to clip into the tank above.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\StructuralAero\NBadapter3x3
		#MRS-NBadapter3x3-titl = MRS Stack Adapter, 3.75m to 3x 2.5m
		#MRS-NBadapter3x3-desc = Unfortunately 3 large circles don't always fit under a bigger circle, but leave it to us to smash several large round pegs into a single larger round hole.

		#MRS-NBadapter3x7-titl = MRS Stack Adapter, 3.75m to 7x 1.25m
		#MRS-NBadapter3x7-desc = To those who are good at geometry, it should be noted that you can indeed fit seven circles inside a single circle of triple the diameter. Who knew!? NOTE: KSP's symmetry doesn't work well with this sort of attachment configuration. We recommend adding parts indivdually.

		#MRS-NBbatteryRadial1-titl = MRS Rechargeable Battery, Radial
		#MRS-NBbatteryRadial1-desc = Perfect for use alongside the radial fuel-cell units, these batteries will store 600 units of electrical charge. Over-charging will void the warranty.

		#MRS-NBdecouplerSlim2m-desc = Now, with smaller explosive charges, decoupling can be done with a more sleek, slim-line design that doesn't destroy the beauty of your rocket designs.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Utility\NBdockingHelper0
		#MRS-NBdockingHelper0-titl = MRS Docking Helper, 0.625m
		#MRS-NBdockingHelper0-desc = Why does docking always seem to happen in the dark? If you are frequently running into this problem, then perhaps you need the Docking Helper, an illuminated ring to help make your docking ports more visible.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Utility\NBdockingHelper1
		#MRS-NBdockingHelper1-titl = MRS Docking Helper, 1.25m
		#MRS-NBdockingHelper1-desc = Why does docking always seem to happen in the dark? If you are frequently running into this problem, then perhaps you need the Docking Helper, an illuminated ring to help make your docking ports more visible.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Utility\NBxenonSphere
		#MRS-NBxenonSphere-titl = MRS Pressurized Xenon Container, Small
		#MRS-NBxenonSphere-desc = While observing that ballons naturally inflate into a spheroidal shape, our engineers had a sudden insight into how to shape a pressurized container. With luck, it will hold your xenon for as long as needed, without exploding.
