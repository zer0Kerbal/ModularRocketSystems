	// Agent
		#MRS-titl = Modular Rocket Systems
		#MRS-desc = Somewhat of a "Rockomax wanna-be", this new corporation crawled out of the woodwork to start making competitive rocket products. While not as concerned with propulsion systems, focus has been shifted to making cost-competitive alternatives to fuel storage, structural, and aerodynamic components. While relatively unknown in the rocket industry, MRS hopes to secure a position in this growing market.

		#MRS-probe-cone-125-titl = MRS Guidance Nose-Cone
		#MRS-probe-cone-125-desc = Most space agencies seem to think that starting with manned missions is the way to go. At MRS, we disagree, and think it is much safer to send automated rockets into the sky first. This guidance unit will let you do so in style!

		#MRS-probe-radial-1-titl = MRS Radial Controller Panel
		#MRS-probe-radial-1-desc = Sometimes there just isn't a good place to put controlling electronics inside your vehicle. Radially attached probe core, to the rescue!

		#MRS-NB3mQuadEngine-desc = Determined to out-do Kerbodyne's engineers, the MRS design team came up with what they consider to be one of the most massive engines to date. It does indeed out-thrust the KS25x4 Mammoth, but at the expense of some vacuum efficiency.

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\Engine\NBintake0m
		#MRS-NBinstake0m-titl = MRS Intake, 0.625m Ram Air

		#MRS-fuelcell-125-titl = MRS Inline Fuel Cell Array 1.25m

	// ModularRocketSystems\Parts\FuelTank\NBjumboThreeQ
		#MRS-NBjumboThreeQ-titl = MRS Fuel Tank, 2.5m x 5.625m "Three Quarter Jumbo"

		#MRS-rcs-5-desc = Despite widespread belief to the contrary, it appears to be completely possible to build monopropellant valves small enough, that a 5-way thruster block is possible within a managably small housing. True story!

		#MRS-rcs-corner-titl = MRS RCS Thruster Block, angled "corner"
		#MRS-rcs-corner-desc = What does quantum mechanics have to do with RCS thruster blocks? Absolutely nothing! Gauranteed to contain no quantum components.These RCS thrusters are angled to allow use on the diagonal "corner" positions of your vehicle, and still thrust efficiently in the direction you are steering.

		#MRS-rtg-0625-desc = A slightly larger, more heat tolerant source of consistent electrical power that can also double as a space heater inside of rovers, for the enterprising sojourner.
